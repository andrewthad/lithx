# Notes

The compilation stages are roughly:

* E-Exprs (uses library)
* Syntax (unresolved names)
* Untyped (resolved names)
* Typed (typechecking completed)
* Monomorphized

Important types are:

* Type (references Type)
* Term (references Lit, Term, and Type)
* Lit (references Lit, Term, and Type)

# Thoughts on Hiding Details

Keeping these opaque rules out possible bad implementations. Where else
could something similar be used? During typechecking, we don't particularly
care about the values of integer and bits literals, so we could make
literals more opaque to the typechecker.
Similarly, certain optimization passes do not need to inspect types, so
we could make them agnostic to type annotations on terms.
